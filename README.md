# Chrome-Dino-Game
I automated chrome dino game using modules in python.
The code is running absolutely fine, but when any bird comes in the path of dino at low height then it ducks ,but then again it does not stand straight 
and in the next obstacle it collides and game is over.
Please someone help me resolve this issue.
